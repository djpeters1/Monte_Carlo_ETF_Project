# Monte_Carlo_ETF_Project
For this project Alex Tunnell and I created an Exchange-traded fund (ETF) comprised of the ten highest market capitalized stocks, weighting based upon this metric, and simulated its behavior over a 3 month period (4/12/19-7/15/19). These companies were: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Facebook, Johnson \& Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Visa, Exxon Mobil, and, Berkshire Hathaway. 
We priced Asian and Lookback options on this ETF and observed its behavior in stressed market conditions, using the 2018 4th quarter sell-off (11/23/18-12/31/18) as a basis. 
To reduce variance and expedite the simulation we employed antithetic variables. This improvement over a crude approach is examined at some length.

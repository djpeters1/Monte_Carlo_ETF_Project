# Monte_Carlo_ETF_Project
For this project Alex Tunnell and I analyzed the ten highest market capitalized companies in the U.S. These companies were: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Facebook, Johnson \& Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Visa, Exxon Mobil, and, Berkshire Hathaway. Our goal was to create an Exchange-traded fund (ETF) that held these companies. In addition, we wanted to find the fair market price of Asian and Lookback options based off our ETF. Also, We desired to check the projected behavior of the ETF under normal and stressed market conditions so that we could see how they compare during a three month long forecast. There are many ways one can perform simulations, but through the use of variance reduction techniques, one can run much more efficient simulations. Therefore, we used a crude approach and a more sophisticated approach using antithetic variables. We then sought to compare the two methods and show the benefits of using antithetic variables.
